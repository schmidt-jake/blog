# How I automated my blog with [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)
![](assets/logo.png "GitHub Actions")
In this post, I will show you how I automated the publication of my blog using GitHub new-ish CICD tool, [Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).

<!-- When I decided to start this blog, I wanted to be able to share my industry data science and ML engineering in a meaningful way. That means showing how we use production tooling to create robust, mission-critical software. Well, a blog -->

The goals are:
- Show how I use version control to track and manage the blog writing process.
- Ensure that all the code I write to accompany each post is properly formatted and passes all tests.
- Showcase the power of GitHub Actions.

## Guiding Principles
### Never Break Master
### Develop Tests First
### Automate Error-Prone and Boring Stuff
(within reason)
